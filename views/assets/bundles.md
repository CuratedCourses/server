Sometimes it is easier to explore content when it is bundled together.

You can view some of the CuratedCourses resources bundled together [as a Canvas
course](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1045744).

IMSCC files are export files of a course from a learning management system. 
These files can be imported into most major learning management systems (such as Canvas, 
Moodle, Blackboard, Desire2Learn, etc.) to give you a personal copy for your class which 
can be edited to suit your needs. 
You can [download IMSCC bundles](https://utexas.box.com/v/imscc) of some CuratedCourses
resources designed for online and flipped courses.
Note: Some of the IMSCC files above are quite large.
