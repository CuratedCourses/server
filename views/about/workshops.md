# Summary of workshop and mini-course activities

We developed and curated a comprehensive set of OER materials for linear algebra including videos, worksheets, pre-class activities, in-class activities, quiz questions, how-to-make videos guide. These materials are for linear algebra courses ranging from applied courses for non-majors to courses for math majors. We created a system to identify hundreds of individual tags for topics in linear algebra and mapped these tags to the sections of three linear algebra textbooks. We developed web intefraces for individuals to upload, describe and tag resources and to to browse and search for curated material. The Tacoma workshop, jointly run with the UTMOST project, focused on the integration of online materials and online textbooks.

The mini-courses were targeted at college faculty to enable them to implement a flipped classroom approach with open educational resources.
