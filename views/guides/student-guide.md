Have you ever been frustrated when trying to Google for how-to videos and apps that might
help you learn mathematics? Curated Courses is a great way to find high quality materials 
to assist you in studying! Each [resource](/assets/) is hand-selected by experts in
mathematics and mathematics education, so you know you'll get quality content that is
applicable to your studies.

# Content to support your class/textbook

Many students find themselves struggling with particular topics, not because they aren't
trying to learn, but because they just haven't encountered the right visualization or
explanation of the related idea. 

If you need an alternative explanation for a topic in your mathematics course,
CuratedCourses may be able to help!

- If you are using a [textbook](/textbooks/) in our database, you can look up
  resources by section. 
- If your book is not available, or if you don't have a textbook, no worries!
  Several of the textbooks in our database
  (for example, [Beezer](http://linear.ups.edu/) and
  [Hefferon](http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/book.pdf)) 
  are free and open-source, and can be viewed directly in your browser. 
- Also, content can be
  searched for or filtered by topic.
  For example, here is a collection of resources related to the
  [dot product](https://curatedcourses.org/assets/?q=dot+product).

# Content for self-guided learning or review

If you are exploring a field of mathematics on your own, CuratedCourses has
several resources to help you along the way. In addition to curating
several [free and open-source textbooks](/textbooks/) that can be viewed
in your browser, we've curated [bundles](/bundles/) of course content together
