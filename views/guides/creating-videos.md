# Recording Audio
  - Use a good quality microphone.
     - CuratedCourses workshop used CAD Audio U37 usb Cardioid Condenser Studio Recording Microphone.
  - Use a p-filter/pop screen.
    - CuratedCourses workshop used CAD EPF15A.
  - Get a good pair of headphone to be able to listen to your recording.
    - CuratedCourses workshop used Sennheiser HD 202.
  - Try to stay away from background noises.
    - This may include but is not limited to:
        - air conditioner/fridge/etc. kicking on
        - dog barking
        - shared office space
         - etc.
  - If you do have background noise, a constant noise is better - it's easier to remove that way.
  - Drink lots of water.
  - Make sure you've selected the microphone as the input device (and not the built in microphone).
  - Record a small test recording (in your normal recording voice) and go back and listen to it (with your headphones) to make sure it is okay before recording the entire session.
  - If you make a mistake, stop talking for a bit, back up to the beginning of your sentence or thought and start again.
    - Note: the break you take from talking will help you to be able to cut out your mistake more easily. If you make it long enough, it will be a visual cue to where to cut as well.
  - If you are finding the recording sounds echo-y, pillows, blankets, and other soft materials around you help to dampen or soften the recording.
  - Audacity is a good free tool for editing audio.

# Screen Capture
  - Turn off your email and other notifications while you are recording.
  - If you are writing on a tablet, make sure to pick an ink color that is dark enough to be legible to many people.
  - We have yet to find a perfect tool to be able to write on pdf slides. We would love recommendations if someone has found a better workflow. We found that you needed to cut between slide transitions for two reasons:
    - You have to change out of the pen tool to change slides and then turn it back on.
    - The slide transitions are animated and you just want them to replace what's there.
  - If you have a screen capture and you need to make edits, you don't need to redo everything.
     - If you said something wrong, you can rerecord a small section of audio and replace it. We recommend rerecording an entire sentence or section and not just the few words that need replacing.
