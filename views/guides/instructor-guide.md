We know the pain of trying to find high-quality resources for your mathematics course.
Searching Google can result in several top results that lack mathematical rigor,
or perhaps assume certain skills that you haven't covered or accounted for
in your course. CuratedCourses is just that: curated, by experts in mathematics
and mathematics education.

# Tagged and searchable

A lot of care has been put into making sure our resources are thoughtfully
[tagged](/math/la), categorizing resources not just by keywords, but also
by definition, theorem, objective...

Of course, you can also use our [search](/assets/) to look up resources by
name, with the confidence that each resource has been peer reviewed by
our team.

# Supporting active learning

Because CuratedCourses is brought to you by experts in mathematics and
matheamtical education, many of the resources and guides featured here are designed with active
learning in mind. Need a [video on the non-commutativity of matrices][noncomvid]
to flip your classroom? What about a
[guide to create activities that foster inquiry in your classroom][worksheet-guide]?

# Materials for review and independent study

If a student comes to you looking for extra help outside of class,
you may find our [resources](/assets/) useful to provide supplementary
materials for review or remediation. On the other hand, more advanced materials
can also serve as gateway to help you facilitate an independent study!

Regardless, CuratedCourses can help you find ready-to-use resources and web apps that
can demonstrate key concepts for your students.

# Export a complete course package

Given a last-minute prep? We've curated [course packages](/bundles) that
can be easily imported into Canvas and get you up and running quickly!
